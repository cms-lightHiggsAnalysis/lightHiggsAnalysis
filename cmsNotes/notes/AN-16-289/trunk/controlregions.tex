\section{Control regions\label{sec:controlregions}}

Editor: Mengyao Shi
Below is a list of content of what I want to talk about. 
Our control region is defined as the following: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Muons pass a loose selection with pt$>$5GeV, $\abs\eta$ within 2.4
  \item Muons pass medium ID. 
  \item vertex requirements
  \item Let event pass muon trigger, and select highest pt muon that passed trigger(Mu1)
  \item among all isolated muons that are opposite sign to Mu1, we pick highest pt muon as Mu2.
  \item invariant Mass window is set in Z region, 60GeV to 120GeV.
\end{itemize}

In order to improve modeling of data, we added additional corrections or scale factors to simulated events.
reults \ref{fig:invMass}
\begin{itemize}
  \item muon identification scale factor
  \item muon isolation scale factor
  \item muon tracking efficiency
  \item muon trigger efficiency
  \item rochester correction
  \item pile-up reweighting
  \item generation level event weights
\end{itemize}
